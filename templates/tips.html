        <b>Research what foods contain peanuts.</b><br>
        Some foods that contain peanuts are obvious like peanut butter.
        But many other foods contain peanuts as well.
        And because even very small traces of peanuts in food can cause a severe allergic reaction you should know what foods contain peanuts.

            <b>Always be prepared for an allergic reaction.</b><br>
            Even if you do your very best to avoid it.
            You will eventually still come into contact with peanuts.
            So you should always have an epi-pen with you, and you should know how to use it correctly.<br><br>

            <b>Do your research before eating out.</b><br>
            Lots of restaurants list weather a dish contains common allergens.
            So try to lookup beforehand if the restaurant you want to visit does this.
            And if that isn't possible you can ask your server if the dish you want to order contains any peanuts.<br><br>

            <b>Be careful when eating with other people.</b><br>
            When eating over at friends or family they will often be less knowledgeable about what foods contain peanuts.
            So even if they think they made a dish without any peanuts in it,
            they could have accidentally used something that does contain peanuts.
            So you should ask what ingredients they used before eating.<br><br>

            <b>Inform the people around you.</b><br>
            If you have a peanut allergy it helps if the people around you know what to do if you have a severe allergic reaction.
            So that even if you aren't able to use an epi-pen yourself others will notice the symptoms and can apply the epi-pen for you.<br><br>

            <b>Create a peanut free zone.</b><br>
            If you live with other people it helps if you have an area of the house where absolutely nothing that contains peanuts is allowed.
            This really helps to avoid accidental exposure.
